# SFML Game Engine

Custom Game Engine built with SFML and C++ only.

Started from [SFML CMake project template](https://github.com/SFML/cmake-sfml-project), see [infos](SFML.md).

## Sources

This project is based on this course made by [Dave Churchill](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_xRyXins848nDj2v-TJYahzvs-XW9sVV) on YouTube.

All the code is also inspired by the [SFML Game Development Book](https://github.com/SFML/SFML-Game-Development-Book) and an implementation of the course by [Devin Marsh](https://gitlab.com/muncs/comp4300).
